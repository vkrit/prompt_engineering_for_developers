This can reduce the risk of obesity and related health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Additionally, exercise strengthens the muscles and bones, improving overall physical strength and reducing the risk of injuries. Regular physical activity also boosts cardiovascular health by improving blood circulation and lowering blood pressure. Moreover, exercise has a positive impact on mental well-being by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. It promotes the release of endorphins, which are natural mood enhancers, leading to increased happiness and improved overall mental health. Furthermore, regular exercise can enhance cognitive function, memory, and focus. Overall, incorporating exercise into one's routine can lead to a healthier, happier, and more fulfilling life."

It will return `true` if the number is prime, and `false` otherwise."
